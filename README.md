# SatanGo - My first Golang project - Chrigeeel#9456

Hello,

although i wrote this code some time ago and this was my FIRST EVER go project, i hope you can still learn something from itand maybe use it for any of your go projects :)some of the modules might still work but most are probably broken...all apis are still online, even the TL captcha api!feel free to use it, it only works on TL captchas but is pretty decent. it's only running on a 2-core server so don't expect too much though!

i will be adding more comments soon if there's enough demand

# cooldiscord

is https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo but edited so WS-connections work with non-bot tokens.
feel free to use it seperately

# Feel free to contact Chrigeeel#9456

if you need any help with golang development or have any questions about satango!
i've become a lot better since this project too...
